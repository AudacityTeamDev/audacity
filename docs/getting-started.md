# Getting Started Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of setting up Audacity for offline use with our assistant tool.

## Step 1: Download the Assistant

-   Navigate to the [latest release page](https://github.com/AudacityTeamDev/audacity/releases/latest) on our GitHub repository.
-   Download the appropriate package for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

## Step 2: Extract the Files

-   The downloaded file will be a compressed archive (e.g., `.zip` or `.tar.gz`).
-   Use a tool like [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) or the built-in extractor in your OS to extract the files to a new folder.

## Step 3: Run the Setup Tool

-   Navigate into the extracted folder.
-   Locate the setup application.
    -   On **Windows**, it will be `Setup.exe`. Right-click and select "Run as administrator".
    -   On **macOS** and **Linux**, it will be a script named `setup.sh`. Open a terminal in the folder and run `chmod +x setup.sh` followed by `sudo ./setup.sh`.
-   The tool will launch and guide you through the necessary steps.

## Step 4: Follow On-Screen Instructions

-   The assistant will detect your system and the version of Audacity you intend to use.
-   It will prompt you for any required information and perform the necessary configuration changes automatically.
-   This process is entirely offline and does not require an internet connection.

## Step 5: Launch Audacity

-   Once the assistant completes, you can launch Audacity.
-   All features, including MP3 export, will be fully enabled for local use without any need for online activation or login.

Congratulations! You have successfully configured Audacity for a complete offline experience.
